# Project files for legacy-paintsquad
This repository consists of project files for the legacy-paintsquad plugin. It lacks any resource pack files, config files, schematics and external libraries, so getting it to work again is not realistically possible.

The code is a product of its time and contains several programming war crimes. Maybe you can find a helpful thing or two, but for obvious reasons I won't provide any support for this project.
